# First Commit Guide for Team Members

## Initial Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-name>
   ```

2. **Create Your Feature Branch**
   ```bash
   # Replace [your-name] with your actual name (A, B, C, or D)
   git checkout -b feature/[your-name]/initial-setup
   ```

3. **Set Up Remote Tracking** (If you get upstream branch error)
   ```bash
   # If you get the error: "fatal: The current branch has no upstream branch"
   git push --set-upstream origin feature/[your-name]/initial-setup
   
   # Or use the shorter version
   git push -u origin feature/[your-name]/initial-setup
   ```
